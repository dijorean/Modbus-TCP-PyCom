# Exo Sense Py Modbus
Modbus TCP Server app for Exo Sense Py, configurable via FTP or Web server.

## Installation
Just copy all the files in this repo into the Pycom's flash memory.

## User guide
Power on Exo Sense Py, the internal LED light will turn on as fixed red. Wait for the LED to turn blue or green.

If green, the module is already configured and ready to process Modbus requests. On the first Modbus request received 
the LED will go off.

If blue, the module is not configured and is set to access point mode. After some time (see below) the access point will
 be automatically disabled.

### Configuration

All configuration parameters are in the [config.py](config.py) file.

To access this file on the module, enable access point mode and join its WiFi network. Depending on the configuration, 
a Web server and/or an FTP server will be enabled. Using any Web browser or FTP client application, connect to 
192.168.4.1 using the credentials specified in the configuration.

Refer to [config.py](config.py) for the default WiFi, Web and FTP credentials.

Download the configuration file, edit it and re-upload it. If using the Web interface, after the upload, Exo will 
automatically restart using the new configuration, otherwise, on the next power-on, it will start with the new 
configuration.

Configure it to work as Modbus TCP server, by setting `MB_TCP_IP` to a valid value. If not properly set, it will boot 
 _not configured_ and enable the access point at power-on.

When configured as Modbus TCP server, the configuration Web interface and/or FTP server will be available at the 
configured IP address. If Exo cannot connect to the specified WiFi, after the time specified by the `AP_ON_TIMEOUT_SEC` 
configuration parameter, it will go into access point mode.


The above access point mode auto-enable routine can be disabled by setting `AP_ON_TIMEOUT_SEC` to `0`.

The access point is automatically disabled after the time specified by `AP_ON_TIME_SEC`.

## Modbus registers

Refer to the following table for the list of available registers and corresponding supported Modbus functions.

For the "Functions" column:    
1 = Read coils    
2 = Read discrete inputs    
3 = Read holding registers    
4 = Read input registers    
5 = Write single coil    
6 = Write single register    
15 = Write multiple coils    
16 = Write multiple registers
